AMC Question Creator
====================

GUI in python3 using tkinter to automate some of the mundane (and error-prone)
aspects of creating questions for the [AMC test generation software](http://home.gna.org/auto-qcm/ "Auto Multiple Choice").

Currently it is only set up to handle questions with four answers. If any of
the answers are blank, I make no promises as to what the behavior will be. I'm
sure there are many other bugs, but it's actually creating files now!
